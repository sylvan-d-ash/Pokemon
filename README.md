# Pok√©mon

A lightweight Pok√©dex-style iOS app built in SwiftUI + MVVM.
It displays a list of all 1010 Pok√©mon (sourced from a bundled JSON for reliability), supports search by name or ID, and shows detailed information with caching for offline resilience.

## Features

- Browse and view content with a responsive SwiftUI interface  
- Search functionality for quickly finding what you need  
- Dynamic color extraction for a personalized visual experience  
- Offline caching for smoother usage without constant network access  
- Error handling with clear fallback UI states  
- Simple setup: just open the project in Xcode and run

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode 15 or later.
3. Run on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

No additional setup or dependencies are required ‚Äî everything runs out of the box.

## Git Workflow

For this project, I used a simple branching strategy suited for a small, single-developer app:  

- Each feature was developed on its own branch (e.g. `homepage`, `info`, `network`, `caching`, `background-colors`, etc).  
- Once a feature was complete, I opened a Pull Request (PR) and merged it directly into the `main` branch.  
- This approach allowed for clean separation of features while keeping the workflow lightweight, without the overhead of managing long-lived branches.  

Since this was a small project built under time constraints, this lightweight workflow provided both clarity and speed.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Structure

### High-Level Approach

The app is built with **SwiftUI + MVVM** for speed, simplicity, and future-proofing. The structure is organized into folders by responsibility:

* **Core** ‚Üí shared services such as networking, repositories, and caching
* **Models** ‚Üí data models and domain objects
* **Components** ‚Üí reusable SwiftUI UI elements
* **Scenes** ‚Üí feature screens (Home, Info), each with its own `View` and `ViewModel`
* **Extensions** ‚Üí utilities

This balances separation of concerns with the need for rapid delivery.

### Why Not Fully Modularized?

While modularization (separating code into Swift packages or targets) has benefits like clearer boundaries and faster incremental builds, it also adds ceremony.
Given that this app was built in a single day, the trade-offs did not justify the extra overhead.

Instead, a **feature-based folder structure** was chosen, which keeps related files together without fragmenting the project. This is sufficient for clarity at this scale.

If the app were to grow, the next step would be to separate into modules such as:

* `PokemonModels` ‚Üí models and DTOs
* `PokemonCore` ‚Üí networking, repositories, caching
* `PokemonUIComponents` ‚Üí reusable UI components
* `PokemonHome` / `PokemonInfo` ‚Üí feature modules

## üé® Design & Architectural Considerations

### MVVM Choices

* Views are built with **SwiftUI**, while ViewModels handle only **transforming data for display**.
* Services/Repositories are injected into ViewModels for tasks like networking, persistence, and caching.
* I follow Paul Hudson‚Äôs approach of embedding the `ViewModel` as an extension of the `View`. It keeps things tidy, though it does mean files can‚Äôt share the same name (a minor inconvenience).

### Models

* Models double as both DTOs (API decoding) and domain models (UI display), since the data is simple.
* Each model has a static sample instance for use in previews, testing, and prototyping.
* Example: PokeAPI returns height in decimetres and weight in hectograms, so I added computed properties for human-friendly conversions in both metric and imperial. Since these are single-use, no `Constants` were introduced.

### UI Design

* The design is intentionally minimal. Apart from `PokemonImageView` and `PokemonCardView`, no extra components were factored out. Smaller helpers live inside the views themselves.
* In `InfoView`, the title is the Pok√©mon number rather than the name ‚Äî this avoids redundancy since the name is already displayed beneath the image.

### Data Fetching & Caching

* **Pok√©mon list**:

  * PokeAPI requests were unreliable (timeouts in simulator, no support in previews).
  * Since there are only 1010 Pok√©mon, I opted to bundle a local JSON list of IDs and names. This removed the need for pagination and allowed full offline search.
  * `PokemonListService` still demonstrates how pagination *could* be implemented, though it isn‚Äôt used in the final flow.

* **Pok√©mon details**:

  * Downloading all details upfront was not feasible. Instead, `PokemonInfoService` uses a hybrid cache strategy:

    1. **Check in-memory cache** ‚Üí return immediately if found
    2. **Check disk cache** (via `FileManager`) ‚Üí load and also write into memory cache (so each Pok√©mon is only read from disk once)
    3. **Fallback to API** ‚Üí update both memory and disk caches

  * Since only one `InfoView` is shown at a time and `fetchPokemonInfo` is only called once per appearance, race conditions are not a concern. Using `actor`, `NSCache`, or GCD would be overkill here.

Additionally, for offline caching, **FileManager** was chosen instead of CoreData or SwiftData. The reason for this decision was simplicity and lightness ‚Äî FileManager provided a quick, easy-to-implement solution that avoided the extra setup and overhead of database frameworks, while still being sufficient for the caching needs of this project.

### Colors

* `UIImageColors` extracts dominant colors from Pok√©mon images to set dynamic backgrounds. This mimics modern Pok√©dex-inspired UI designs seen on Dribbble/Pinterest, and static colors wouldn‚Äôt achieve the same effect.

### AsyncImage Defaults

* `AsyncImage` uses `EmptyView` as the fallback state.
* A `ProgressView` would misleadingly suggest a loading state even after a failure. A placeholder silhouette image would be ideal, but `EmptyView` was chosen for simplicity given the time constraints.

### Things Deliberately Omitted

To keep scope manageable in a one-day build, the following were skipped as overkill:

* Localization (fewer than 10 strings total)
* Base URL versioning
* Structured logging
* API retry mechanism

## Guiding Principle

**Keep it simple until complexity demands structure.**
For this project‚Äôs scope, a flat but organized folder layout, lightweight MVVM, and pragmatic caching strategies gave the best balance of speed, clarity, and maintainability.
